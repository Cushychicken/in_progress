      "I have a love bordering on obsession with steel guitars; my latest musical endeavour is learning the pedal steel guitar. If you're not familiar, it's easier to show rather than tell - here's [the great Buddy Emmons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21TI7vlOdh4) accompanying Ray Price on \"Night Life\". Buddy's the guy in the bowler hat sitting behind the thing that looks like a table; that table is the pedal steel. It's a great instrument, but supremely complicated to learn - in no large part due to the lack of teaching material available. That's why I was so pumped to find [Greg Cutshaw's steel guitar page](http://www.gregcutshaw.com/). Greg's been kind enough to put together tab of all the great steel guitar riffs he's written over the years. On top of that, he put them up on his website - for free! Spend a few hours combing Amazon for \"C6 pedal steel instruction\" and you'll see why this is such a gold mine!\n",
      "\n",
      "For all of the great info on Greg's page, however, the UX leaves something to be desired. Navigation, generally, is a bit of a headache.  Each page has linked JPGs or PDFs, each with its own (rarely consistent) naming scheme. I'd like to be able to flip through these in the Finder on my Mac, maybe print them out into a book, or (if I get really ambitious) arrange them into an Anki set with audio samples. To do any of that, however, you first need to grab the images - all 25 pages of them, with ~50 tabs per page. Who wants to do that by hand when we've got Python to do it for us?\n",

I sprinkled in a dash of exception handling to deal with any possible formatting foibles along the way. "
